Java Beginner Questions Repository
This repository contains a list of Java beginner questions that you can use to practice your Java programming skills.
These questions are suitable for those who are new to programming or learning Java as their first programming language.

Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from the official Java website.
Once you have Java installed, you can use any Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to work on the questions. I will prefer netbeans and VSCode for practising Java.
